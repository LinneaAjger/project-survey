# Survey form with React

The task was to create a survey using React. It was mandatory to use radio buttons and a dropdown menu and it should end with a summary with the results. 

## The problem

I used google to find some solutions for the radiobuttons, but other than that I got what i needed from the live session. When I have more time I'll add some more functions and give more feedback to the user.
